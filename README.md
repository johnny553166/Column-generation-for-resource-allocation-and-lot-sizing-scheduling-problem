# Column-generation-for-resource-allocation-and-lot-sizing-scheduling-problem
This is the implmentation of the column generation procedure for the resource allocation and lot sizing scheduling problem.
Which consider 55 facilities, 45 products within 20 time period problem instance. In the computational result,the algorithm provided 7% GAP and the Gurobi solver can not obtain the feasible solution with the same time limit (1800 seconds).
